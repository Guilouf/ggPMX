ggPMX R package
This is a temprary repository. ggPMX code is stilleprivate (under github). We will migrate it to publicdomain assson as possible.

ggPMX is an open-source R package freely available on CRAN since April 2019. It builds on the R-package ggplot2 and provides a library of reproducible diagnostic plots needed for longitudinal population model building and validation. The package aims at providing a workflow that is consistent and efficient, resulting in high quality graphics ready-to-use in submission documents and publications. Intuitive functions and options allow for optimal figure customization and graphics stratification. ggPMX enables straightforward generation of PDF, Word or PNG output files that contain all diagnostic plots for keeping track of modeling results. The package is currently compatible with Monolix versions 2016 and 2018R1.
